# Quantum ML Framework

A revolutionary framework that combines quantum computing principles with machine learning to solve complex optimization problems.

## Innovation

Our framework bridges the gap between quantum computing and traditional machine learning, enabling:

- Quantum-enhanced neural networks
- Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms
- Quantum feature maps
- Quantum kernel methods

## Performance

Benchmark results show up to 100x speedup on specific optimization problems compared to classical approaches.

## Future Development

We're actively working on:

- Quantum error correction
- Larger qubit support
- New quantum ML algorithms
- Industry-specific applications
